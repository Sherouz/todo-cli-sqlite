# Todo CLI (SQLite Learning Project)

This is a temporary placeholder README.
The project is a command-line Todo application built for practicing SQLite, CRUD operations, backup strategies, and clean project architecture.

## Current Status

Development has not started yet.
The repository will evolve as the database schema, CLI commands, and project structure are implemented.

## Planned Features (MVP)

* Create tasks
* List tasks
* Update and complete tasks
* Delete (soft delete)
* SQLite storage
* Simple backup and restore system

## Notes

This project is primarily for learning and experimenting with SQLite and CLI design.
The final README will be updated after the first working version is implemented.
